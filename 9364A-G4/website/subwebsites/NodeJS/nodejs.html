                    Node js is an open-source, JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code. The Node run-time environment includes
                    everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript. Also Node js uses asynchronous programming.

                    Node.js is a command-line tool that can be run as a regular web server and lets one run JavaScript programs.
                    Node.js also works on a non-blocking I/O model that makes it clean and usable, ideal for the data-intensive real-time applications that have to perform in varied environments.<br><br>
                    It is also best suited for  real-time applications: online games, collaboration tools, chat rooms, etc.
                    Not to mention  that just about any situation where the code might block due to threads can be better addressed with Node.js. Or any situation where you need the application to be event-driven can be handled by Node.js.

                            <b>1. It is fast,</b> So fast that companies are in awe of the speed the Node.js offers. Since it runs on a V8
                            engine that is developed by Google where Node.js it can load files, database or even network connections.

                            because of Node.js. Since Node.js runs similar and is also flexible in that manner.

                            Developers won't even need to modulate their syntax. Node.js also works with real-time web apps with JSON. Storing data

                            <b>4. It can be in-charge of Proxy Servers,</b> Node.js comes to rescue to proxy different services that have different response times or for collecting data from diverse sources.
                            Especially when the server deals with 3rd party resources or saves data such as photos or videos, or even gather data and information
                            from various sources. Node.js can come handy as Proxy if the company lacks the infrastructure for proxy or needs local development in such scenario.

                            Besides the speedy JavaScript performance, the heart of Node.js is the Event Loop. To handle numerous clients, all I/O rigorous tasks in Node.js are undertaken together.

                            The suite is a clear winner in multi-user real-time web apps as in games and chat apps. The event-driven architecture caters to both the client-side and the server-side that are written in JavaScript
                            and thus the synchronization process is fast and orderly. The event loop through web socket protocol which works on TCP handles the multi-user function and prevents the overhead of HTTP for web development.

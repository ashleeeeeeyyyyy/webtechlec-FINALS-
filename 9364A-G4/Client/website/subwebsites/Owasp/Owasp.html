                    <b>INJECTION</b>
                </h4>
                <p class="light center" style = "font-size: 20px;">In our world as it is now, Attackers or hackers have the capability and the capacity to invade or manipulate
                    other people’s data and information by hacking or placing viruses into other people’s computer system.
                    In attacking a computer system or softwares there are many ways on how to do attack. An example of this
                    is placing viruses, trojans, worms, script kiddies, etc. But 1 example also in Injection or Code Injection.
                    Injection is a type of attack where the attacker injects a certain code into applications/softwares and
                    change that application/software’s action or instruction. It is a threat that allows an attacker to input
                    untrusted code to a program and alters its process. This threat could lead to data breach and even manipulation
                    of the program. In other words it would not let that application/software do its job. If the attacker’s
                    code was successfully placed into that application/software it may be very dangerous for the user since
                    worms, trojans may be able to spread out within your computer system. Injections are most often found
                    in queries or databases such as the application/software’s SQL, LDAP, etc.

                    <b>What are the risks?</b>
                </h4>
                <p class="light center" style = "font-size: 20px;">
                    Whenever the attacker has already successfully injected their code into the user’s application/software there are alot of
                    things that may happen, 1st is that the attacker may manipulate or get your data leading to data loss,
                    also the attacker can make your data be corrupt making it unusable. 2nd is that when the attacker is
                    successful it could lead to the loss of C.I.A which is the loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability
                    and accountability meaning that authorized people may not be able to access those secured data that you
                    stored, even though you have already protected it from unauthorized people since the attacker has already
                    been successful in injecting the codes in those applications/softwares. 3rd is that it could lead to
                    host takeover, meaning that the attacker has already successfully taken over your system.

                    <b>How to Prevent:</b>
                </h4>

                <p class="light center" style = "font-size: 20px;">
                    There are many ways on how to prevent injection attacks.One advisable way is  to provide validation methods in every text input that the users will be entering.For example in a login form,It is essential to include validation for username and password. Instead of username, the use of email address is more advisable since it is more difficult to manipulate its validation.This way the user cannot input unnecessary characters that can affect your system once it is sent to the webserver and queried in your database.

                    <b>SECURITY MISCONFIGURATION</b>
                </h4>
                <p class="light center" style = "font-size: 20px;">
                    Technology, software, and applications has recently been getting more and more advanced as time advances. As this goes on,
                    so does security as more and more layers of it get installed to the system. And as this increases, so
                    does the possibility of an attack as well. Every phase of an application’s life cycle, it must be ensures
                    that security is well-kept by the developers to reduce the probability of hacking and such. Every developer
                    must ensure that there is always a proper configuration of files and security.Once this has not been
                    followed, even just once, it may automatically lead to Security Misconfiguration. This is when applications
                    or servers are not configured properly, and leads to multiple non-authorized users to use administration
                    pages and so. This threat could lead to improper data manipulation or even improper acquisition of personal
                    data and company-relevant data. Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities could happen if even one component
                    of a program is susceptible to an attack because of poor security configuration.

                    <b>What are the risks</b>
                </h4>

                <p class="light center" style = "font-size: 20px;">
                    There are multiple situations where vulnerabilities could possibly occur. One example, an application server contains sample
                    apps that were not removed from the production server. What is the threat to this? The sample applications
                    may contain security flaws which attackers could use to play around the server with. Another example,
                    directory listing is enabled on the application server. Users must have encountered the code “ls -la”
                    when using something like ubuntu server, at least once in their careers. Now if this is not disabled
                    in production, attackers could just effortlessly list the directories to locate multiple files. Once
                    they have located the files they require, the could just reverse engineer compiled classes to get the
                    developer’s code. Knowing that possibilities are endless for attackers once misconfiguration has happened,
                    it is better to properly check all security configurations than lose it all on one misplaced permission.

                <p class="light center" style = "font-size: 20px;">
                    First off, it may seem unusual that this is the easiest way to prevent it, but the user must turn off everything by default.
                    From administration interfaces to the use of default accounts and passwords, everything must be disabled.
                    Next is to configure server to avoid unauthorized access and etc. Periodically run scans to aid in detecting
                    missing patches and bad configurations.

                <p class="light center" style="font-size: 20px;">
                    Sensitive Data are information such as your Driver’s license,Credit card #, passwords and many more others.This implies that when those information comes into someone’s use without your consent.This occurs when a user has mistakenly has uploaded its information somewhere in the web.In this situation hackers will have more chances on accessing the data without the correct headers and browser caching.As an developer,it is its first priority to secure the sensitive information.This is a advantage for school projects,small companies and small tech enthusiast since they try to build a self built solution but not noticing that that is not enough.As for password situations,a 100 million passwords on VK.com was leaked.This means that a attacker can get the exact password as you have if they are the same with the one in VK.com.That is why it is advisable to have a unique password to differentiate it from others.

                <p class="light center" style="font-size: 20px;"> 
                    Exposure of data may be ignorable at first,if the data that was read or accessed is just an account on a free and non purchase website.It gets more serious when the information that will be taken by the hackers will be your credit card no.,Tin number,email accounts and even personal information.This can lead to issues like identity theft, and can lead you into personal problems and bankruptcy.

                <p class="light center" style = "font-size: 20px;">
                    As a user, we can prevent this by being more informed on how technology works.For example,As a user I won’t be keying in my credit card no. if the website does not provide a HTTPS.and at the same time as a web developer,The data should be never in a clear text format and should not be transmitted with clear text between the user into the web server.Another way is providing two way authenticator to the users for another layer of security.This may come in forms like text messages or be sent in your email address.Another way to prevent this situation is only store sensitive data only when it is necessary. The developer must ensure that the passwords are encrypted with strong algorithm to increase password protections from external threats

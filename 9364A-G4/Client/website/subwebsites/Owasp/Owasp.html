                    <b>INJECTION</b>
                </p>
                <p class="light center">In our world as it is now, Attackers or hackers have the capability and the capacity to invade or manipulate other people’s data and information by hacking or placing viruses into other people’s computer system. In attacking a computer system or softwares there are many ways on how to do attack. An example of this is placing viruses, trojans, worms, script kiddies, etc. But 1 example also in Injection or Code Injection. Injection is a type of attack where the attacker injects a certain code into applications/softwares and change that application/software’s action or instruction. 	It is a threat that allows an attacker to input untrusted code to a program and alters its process. This threat could lead to data breach and even manipulation of the program. In other words it would not let that application/software do its job. If the attacker’s code was successfully placed into that application/software it may be very dangerous for the user since worms, trojans may be able to spread out within your computer system. Injections are most often found in queries or databases such as the application/software’s SQL, LDAP, etc.

                <p class="promo-caption"><b>What are the risks?</b></p>
                <p class="light center">
                        Whenever the attacker has already successfully injected their code into the user’s application/software there are alot of things that may happen, 1st is that the attacker may manipulate or get your data leading to data loss, also the attacker can make your data be corrupt making it unusable. 2nd is that when the attacker is successful it could lead to the loss of C.I.A which is the loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability and accountability meaning that authorized people may not be able to access those secured data that you stored, even though you have already protected it from unauthorized people since the attacker has already been successful in injecting the codes in those applications/softwares. 3rd is that it could lead to host takeover, meaning that the attacker has already successfully taken over your system.

                <p class="light center">
                    Technology, software, and applications has recently been getting more and more advanced as time advances. As this goes on, so does security as more and more layers of it get installed to the system. And as this increases, so does the possibility of an attack as well. Every phase of an application’s life cycle, it must be ensures that security is well-kept by the developers to reduce the probability of hacking and such. Every developer must ensure that there is always a proper configuration of files and security.Once this has not been followed, even just once, it may automatically lead to Security Misconfiguration. This is when applications or servers are not configured properly, and leads to multiple non-authorized users to use administration pages and so. This threat could lead to improper data manipulation or even improper acquisition of personal data and company-relevant data. Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities could happen if even one component of a program is susceptible to an attack because of poor security configuration.

                <p class="promo-caption"><b>What are the risks</b></p>
                
                <p class="light center">
                    There are multiple situations where vulnerabilities could possibly occur. One example, an application server contains sample apps that were not removed from the production server. What is the threat to this? The sample applications may contain security flaws which attackers could use to play around the server with. Another example, directory listing is enabled on the application server. Users must have encountered the code “ls -la” when using something like ubuntu server, at least once in their careers. Now if this is not disabled in production, attackers could just effortlessly list the directories to locate multiple files. Once they have located the files they require, the could just reverse engineer compiled classes to get the developer’s code. Knowing that possibilities are endless for attackers once misconfiguration has happened, it is better to properly check all security configurations than lose it all on one misplaced permission.

                <p class="promo-caption"><b>How to Prevent:</b></p>
                
                <p class="light center">
                First off, it may seem unusual that this is the easiest way to prevent it, but the user must turn off everything by default. From administration interfaces to the use of default accounts and passwords, everything must be disabled. Next is to configure server to avoid unauthorized access and etc. Periodically run scans to aid in detecting missing patches and bad configurations.
